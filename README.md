# **Imperceptible, Designable, and Scalable** Braided Electronic Cord

## Data acquisition

A multichannel capacitance-analyzing circuit with a Bluetooth module (Zhihe 01RC) was designed and manufactured by Linkzill. The chip used in the device is a thin-film transistor (TFT) semiconductor chip independently developed by Linkzill Technology. The chip can realize high-throughput digital liquid programming control, high-throughput and high-precision array signal control and detection, and large-area and low-cost biological signal acquisition. This chip serves the industrial application of life science, sensor display, and other cross fields Scenes.
